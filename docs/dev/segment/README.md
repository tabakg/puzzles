# Segmentation

## Active Contour Model

[This algorithm](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/edges/plot_active_contours.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-edges-plot-active-contours-py) seems to be best suited for when we have knowledge about the area where the contour
is. This could pair well with another algorithm to "fine tune" a segmentation.
